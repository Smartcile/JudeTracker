Ship issue $1.

Read `.agent/ISSUES` first. If it exists, use every issue number in it; otherwise use `$1`.

1. Run `npm run typecheck`.
2. Run `npm run test`; run `npm run build` when the client changed.
3. Commit any remaining changes on the current `issue/<number>-...` or `wave/<slug>` branch.
4. Confirm the branch is not `master` or `main`.
5. If any issue has the `needs:screenshot` label, capture one screenshot using `scripts/agent/capture-screenshot.ps1` and keep its URL. If no issue has that label, skip the screenshot.
6. Push the branch with `git push -u origin HEAD`.
7. Open a PR to `master` with `gh pr create --base master`.
   - Put one `Fixes #<number>` line per issue in the body.
   - Include the screenshot URL in the PR body if one was captured.
8. Comment on every issue with the PR URL, the checks run, and the screenshot image if one was captured.
9. Add the `agent:review` label to every issue.

Do not merge the PR, force-push, or push to `master` or `main`.
