# AGENT WORKFLOW

One issue = one branch = one worktree = one worker session. Related issues can share one wave. GitHub is the source of truth.

For the copy-paste activation prompt for a new session, see `NEXT-SESSION.md`.

Everything here is used from the OpenCode Desktop chat. No terminal or CLI is required. The agents run the scripts for you.

Type `/workflow` at any time to show these steps again.

## Defaults

- Integration branch: `master` (PR base)
- Single worktree: `.worktrees/issue-<number>`
- Grouped worktree: `.worktrees/wave-<slug>`
- Single branch: `issue/<number>-<slug>`
- Grouped branch: `wave/<slug>`
- Worker mode: manual (open the worktree in OpenCode Desktop, select the `implementer` agent)
- Merge: one PR per issue or wave, merged one at a time
- Screenshots: only when requested, using the `needs:screenshot` label

## Issue titles

Every triaged issue gets a clean title:

```text
[AREA] Short imperative description
```

Areas: `[LOGGING]`, `[TRIPS]`, `[PHOTOS]`, `[READINGS]`, `[CLAIMS]`, `[VEHICLES]`, `[CALENDAR]`, `[SETTINGS]`, `[PLACES]`, `[AUTH]`, `[EXPORT]`, `[UI]`, `[OTHER]`.

Keep it under 72 characters, sentence case, no full stop. For a group, every issue uses the same area prefix.

## Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `agent:planned` | A triage comment with a fix plan has been posted |
| `agent:approved` | The plan has been reviewed; spawn is allowed |
| `agent:working` | A worktree and branch exist |
| `agent:review` | PR is open and ready for review |
| `agent:blocked` | Waiting on a human decision |
| `agent:merged` | Merged |
| `needs:screenshot` | Capture and post a screenshot before approving the merge |

Create the labels once per repo:

```powershell
"agent:planned","agent:approved","agent:working","agent:review","agent:blocked","agent:merged","needs:screenshot" |
  ForEach-Object { gh label create $_ --color ededed 2>$null }
```

## Single-issue pipeline

1. `/triage <number>` - read-only investigation, title cleanup, and a fix-plan comment.
2. You review the comment and add `agent:approved`.
3. `/spawn <number>` - creates the worktree, branch, `.agent/TASK.md`, dependencies.
4. Open the worktree in OpenCode Desktop, select `implementer`, and say: `Read .agent/TASK.md and implement it.`
5. `@reviewer review the diff for the issues in .agent/ISSUES` - read-only review.
6. If you want a visual check, run `/screenshot <number>` before approving the merge.
7. You review the diff and run the relevant checks.
8. `/ship <number>` - typecheck/tests/build, push, PR, issue update, screenshot if requested.
9. Merge one PR at a time in GitHub. Merging to `master` auto-closes `Fixes #...` issues; still run `/merged <pr>` to add `agent:merged`.

## Grouped pipeline

Use this for 2-4 related issues that share files or a user flow. Do not group unrelated areas.

1. `/triage-group 12 13 14` - one combined plan, every title cleaned up, each issue labelled `agent:planned`.
2. You review the plan and add `agent:approved` to every issue.
3. `/spawn-group 12 13 14 readings claims` - one worktree and branch for the group. Pass the issue numbers as a comma-separated list to the script (`-Issues "12,13,14"`).
4. Open the worktree in OpenCode Desktop, select `implementer`, and say: `Read .agent/TASK.md and implement it.`
5. `@reviewer review the diff for the issues in .agent/ISSUES`.
6. Run `/screenshot <lead-issue>` if you want a visual check.
7. `/ship-group` - one PR with `Fixes #12`, `Fixes #13`, `Fixes #14`.
8. Merge the wave PR once, then run `/merged <pr>` to label every issue and close anything left open.

## Screenshots on request

Screenshots are optional. The agent only captures one when you ask, or when an issue has `needs:screenshot`.

```text
/screenshot 11
```

The agent:

1. builds the client and starts the app in the worktree on a unique port;
2. opens it in headless Chrome or Edge;
3. signs in with the app PIN when `-Role app`;
4. captures the page at the requested viewport;
5. publishes the image to the `agent-screenshots` branch;
6. posts it as a comment on the issue.

Login is a PIN pad, not an email form. Set `AGENT_SCREENSHOT_PIN` in `.env` (or pass `-Pin` to the script). The PIN must be the one already configured for the database the server is using.

Authenticated screenshots also need the local Postgres database running (`docker compose up -d db`). If the database is down, the login step fails before the screenshot is captured; do not merge the screenshot gate silently - record the blocker or run `/screenshot` again once the database is up.

Limits:
- Headless Chrome cannot reproduce iOS Safari's focus zoom. For iOS-only CSS, take a real iPhone screenshot manually.
- A screenshot is a visual aid, not a substitute for testing.

## Plain-text prompts

If a slash command does not appear, paste these into the OpenCode Desktop chat.

| Step | Slash command | Plain text |
|---|---|---|
| Triage | `/triage 21` | `Triage GitHub issue 21. Use the triager role and follow WORKFLOW.md. Rename the title, post the fix plan, and add agent:planned.` |
| Group triage | `/triage-group 12 13 14` | `Triage GitHub issues 12, 13, 14 as one group. Use the triager role. Rename each title, post one combined plan, and add agent:planned to each.` |
| Spawn | `/spawn 21` | `Spawn issue 21 into a worktree using the orchestrator role and scripts/agent/spawn-issue.ps1. Report the branch and folder.` |
| Group spawn | `/spawn-group 12 13 14` | `Spawn issues 12,13,14 as one wave using scripts/agent/spawn-issue.ps1 -Issues 12,13,14 -Name "readings claims". Report the branch and folder.` |
| Review | `/review` | `Review the current worktree diff using the reviewer role. Read .agent/ISSUES. Read-only. Report blocking, non-blocking, and a verdict.` |
| Screenshot | `/screenshot 11` | `Capture a screenshot for issue 11 and post it to the issue. Use the screenshot plan from the triage comment.` |
| Ship | `/ship 21` | `Ship issue 21. Read .agent/ISSUES, run typecheck/tests/build, capture a screenshot only if needs:screenshot is set, push, open a PR to master, comment on the issue, add agent:review.` |
| Group ship | `/ship-group` | `Ship the grouped worktree. Read .agent/ISSUES, run checks, capture screenshots only for issues with needs:screenshot, push, open one PR with Fixes lines, and comment on every issue.` |
| Status | `/status` | `Run scripts/agent/status.ps1 and scripts/agent/merge-check.ps1 and summarize the active work.` |
| Merged | `/merged 22` | `Mark PR 22 as merged: close its issues and add agent:merged.` |
| Commit setup | none | `Commit and push the workflow setup files to master.` |
| Merge | none | Use GitHub in the browser or GitHub Desktop. Do not ask an agent to merge. |

## Using OpenCode Desktop

1. Restart OpenCode after adding agents, commands, or config. If a slash command does not appear, use the plain-text prompt instead.
2. Run `/triage 21` in the main project chat, or paste the plain-text version.
3. Read the triage comment on GitHub and add `agent:approved`.
4. Run `/spawn 21`. The agent runs the script; the script creates the worktree, branch, task brief, and installs dependencies.
5. In OpenCode Desktop, open the new worktree as a project. Select the `implementer` agent and say: `Read .agent/TASK.md and implement it.`
6. In that worktree chat, run `@reviewer review the diff for the issues in .agent/ISSUES`.
7. Review the diff yourself. If you need the app running, use a unique port such as `8199`.
8. Run `/screenshot <issue>` if you want a visual update before merging.
9. Run `/ship <issue>` (or `/ship-group`) in the worktree chat.
10. Merge the PR in GitHub web or GitHub Desktop. Merge one PR at a time.
11. Run `/merged <pr>` after the merge. This adds `agent:merged`; GitHub already closes `Fixes #...` issues when the PR targets `master`.

## Rules

- Commit and push this setup to `master` before the first spawn. The spawn script bases worktrees on `origin/master` and refuses a dirty checkout.
- Restart OpenCode after adding agents, commands, or config.
- Workers never run `db:push`, `db:generate`, `db:studio`, migrations, seed, Docker, or a shared dev server.
- Schema changes: serialize them, or give that worktree its own `DATABASE_URL`.
- Do not run two issues that touch the same files in parallel.
- Group only 2-4 related issues. Do not group unrelated areas just to reduce branches.
- Keep 2-3 workers active at most.
- Never auto-merge AI PRs. Human review is the gate.
- Remove the worktree only after the PR is merged.
- To commit or push without a terminal, ask OpenCode in plain text.
- To merge without a terminal, use GitHub in the browser or GitHub Desktop.
